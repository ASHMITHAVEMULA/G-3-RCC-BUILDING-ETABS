# G+3 RCC Building Design using ETABS

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involves modeling, analysis and design of a G+3 RCC framed structure using ETABS software.

## 🏗 Details
- Software: ETABS
- Design Code: IS 456:2000
- Story Height: 3m
- Loads Applied: Dead Load, Live Load, Wind Load
- Analysis Type: Linear Static Analysis

## ✅ Design Checks Performed
- Load combinations created
- Story drift verified
- Base reactions checked
- Column P-M-M interaction ratio verified
- Maximum Interaction Ratio = 1.0 (Safe)

## 🎯 Conclusion
The structure was analyzed and designed successfully and found to be safe under given load combinations.
